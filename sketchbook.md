## #3 **Added to issues**
**TODO**:  
Write a script that creates the wanted file structure to a already existing repository. So no need to create the repository from the command line, just create the file structure.  
Try it out by using the API and also just using mkdir and touch commands.

## #2 
Did some test scripts and shit. Legit request keeps givin me 404 so that needs to be sorted out. 
The repotest.py and this curl:  
curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: token <token>" https://api.github.com/jomppeli/repos -d '{"name":"test"}'
{
  "message": "Not Found",
  "documentation_url": "https://developer.github.com/v3"
}  
Both give 404 so that's a problem.
## #1
Setup the repos file structure and write down the used file structure options to readme.
