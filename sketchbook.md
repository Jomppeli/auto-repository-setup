## #3 **Added to issues**
**TODO**:  
Write a script that creates the wanted file structure to a already existing repository. So no need to create the repository from the command line, just create the file structure.

## #2 
Did some test scripts and shit. Legit request keeps givin me 404 so that needs to be sorted out. 
The repotest.py and this curl:  
curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: token <token>" https://api.github.com/jomppeli/repos -d '{"name":"test"}'
{
  "message": "Not Found",
  "documentation_url": "https://developer.github.com/v3"
}  
Both give 404 so that's a problem.
## #1
Setup the repos file structure and write down the used file structure options to readme.
