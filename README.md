After the structure is created, the script informs the user:

```  
  
The created structure in Sublime Text:  
![image_header](https://github.com/Jomppeli/auto-repository-setup/blob/master/dev/documentation/images/4.PNG)
  
The created structure in Github:  
  
![image_header](https://github.com/Jomppeli/auto-repository-setup/blob/master/dev/documentation/images/2.PNG)
  

The script recognizes the given file extensions and uses pre defined example files in the directories.  
For example the JSON file:

### 2. Preview the predefined file structures
Type 2 and hit enter. The script shows all example files and structures that you have created and saved:
```
Choose a structure:

1. example-structure
2. html-js-php-example
3. python-example
4. teststructure
5. the-best
```
After choosing one of the examples, the script then prints out the file structure:
```
-projectname
--dev
---resources
----data
-----example.json
----python
-----example.py
--documentation
---example.md
--README.md
--sketchbook.md
```
From here you can see the whole structure that would be created, if you choose to use the given example.  
### 3. Creating own file structures
Type 3 in the main menu and hit enter. The script gives information of the creation process:
```
Create your own file structure by giving an input and pressing enter.
Use dashes as an indentation to make nested structures.
For example:
-Folder1
--fileinfolder1.txt
--folderinsidefolder1
-Folder2
To add an file, give it a file extension e.g file.txt.
Every item without extension is treated as a directory.
When the structure is ready, press enter.

THE STRUCRUTE HAS TO BE ORDERED FOR IT TO WORK!
```
Follow the instructions and create your own file structure:
```
:-testproject
:--development
:---example.py
:---tasklist.md
:--documentation
:---document.md
:--readme.md
```
The script recognizes the given file extensions and uses predefined example files as a placeholders. The example files can be found from **dev/resources/python/examplefiles**. The files are base64 encoded.  
  
Continue and save the structure if needed or start over:
```
1. Continue
2. Start over
```
Save the structure with a wanted filename:
```
Want to save the made structure to be used later?
1. YES
2. NO
:1
Name of the file:
: the-best-structure
the-best-structure saved!
```
The creation is now done. You can use the creation straight away and enjoy your beautiful file structure!
